## Development Goals

### Phase 1: User API Paging (COMPLETED)
- Add pagination functionality to user API
- Implementation details:
  - Spring Data JDBC ListPagingAndSortingRepository
  - Controller pagination parameters (page, size, sortBy, sortDir)
  - Updated response format with pagination metadata
  - Fixed all tests for new paginated response structure

### Phase 2: Development Authentication & Role Removal (COMPLETED)
- Add DEV_AUTH header support for development environment
  - Header format: {id}:{user_id}:{name}
  - Process before JWT token filter
  - Only active in test, dev, local, default profiles
- Remove role system entirely for development convenience
- Update JWT token provider
- Refactor all role-related code and tests
- Create common DEV_AUTH helper methods in TestUtils
- Add @ActiveProfiles("test") for all test classes
- Update documentation

### Phase 3: API Documentation Update (COMPLETED)
- Comprehensive API documentation update
  - Added DEV_AUTH section with detailed usage guide
  - Updated all User API docs to reflect role system removal
  - Unified all curl examples to use DEV_AUTH for development
  - Added production JWT authentication guide
  - Updated pagination documentation for GetUsersController
  - Removed role fields from all API response examples

### Phase 4: Frontend Implementation (COMPLETED)
- Updated admin frontend to support backend API changes
  - Modified API types to remove role fields and support pagination response
  - Updated user list page with proper pagination implementation
  - Refactored user detail page to remove role-related functionality
  - Fixed all TypeScript errors and improved type safety
  - Used @onMounted lifecycle hook for better UX

### Phase 5: Code Quality & Architecture Improvements (COMPLETED)
- Improved code structure and maintainability
  - Removed unnecessary comments and verbose code
  - Implemented page-specific composables for better organization
  - Created structured return objects (state, actions, ui, pagination)
  - Applied consistent naming conventions and TypeScript types
  - Organized composables by domain proximity rather than global reusability
  - Achieved clean separation between UI logic and business logic

### Phase 6: Documentation Enhancement (COMPLETED)
- Updated comprehensive project documentation
  - Enhanced main API documentation (docs/api/index.md) with v0.2539.11 features
  - Updated admin README.md with latest authentication and pagination features
  - Created admin frontend development rules (admin/front/devrule.md)
  - Established CRUD page development standards and patterns
  - Added file references and template guidelines for future development
  - Documented page-specific composables architecture pattern
